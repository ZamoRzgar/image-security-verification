Project Context: Secure Image Verification Web Application
Overview: The Secure Image Verification Web App is designed to authenticate images by ensuring that they are uploaded by the rightful owner and have not been tampered with. The application leverages cryptographic techniques—specifically RSA-based digital signatures and hash functions—to create a trustworthy mechanism for image verification.

Purpose:

Authenticity: Verify that an image was captured by the registered user by using a digital signature (generated with a private key) that accompanies the image.
Integrity: Ensure the image remains unaltered by comparing the computed hash of the image with the one provided at the time of upload.
Security: Maintain high security standards by keeping the private key exclusively with the user while storing only the public key on the server.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Next.js, for a dynamic, server-side rendered React application.
Backend & Database: Supabase, which provides authentication, real-time database, and file storage capabilities, ensuring scalable and secure management of user data and uploaded files.
Cryptography: Utilizes RSA key pair generation, encryption, and hash computation (using Node.js crypto or Web Crypto API) to secure the image verification process.
Deployment: Planned deployment on Vercel, providing a robust hosting environment with built-in support for Next.js applications.
Key Functional Components:

User Registration and Key Generation:

Users register using email and password.
Upon registration, an RSA key pair is generated.
The public key is stored in the Supabase database (in a dedicated profiles table), while the private key is securely provided to the user for local storage.
Image Upload and Processing:

Users select an image and the app computes its cryptographic hash (e.g., using SHA-256).
The image is then encrypted with the user’s private key before being transmitted.
Both the encrypted image and the computed hash are sent to the server (or Supabase Storage).
Image Verification:

The server retrieves the user’s public key from Supabase.
It decrypts the image using the public key and recalculates its hash.
A match between the recalculated hash and the originally submitted hash confirms that the image is authentic and unaltered.
Security Considerations:

Private Key Confidentiality: The private key never leaves the client device, ensuring that only the user can sign their uploads.
Data Integrity: Use of robust hash functions to detect any tampering with the image data.
Encrypted Communications: All client-server communications are performed over HTTPS to safeguard against interception.
Workflow Summary:

Set-Up:
Initialize the project with Next.js.
Configure Supabase for authentication, storage, and database needs.
User Enrollment:
Register and generate RSA keys.
Store the public key in the Supabase database.
Image Upload:
Compute the image hash.
Encrypt the image using the user’s private key.
Upload the encrypted image and its hash.
Verification:
Retrieve and use the public key to decrypt the image.
Verify integrity by comparing hashes.
Deployment & Maintenance:
Deploy the app on Vercel.
Monitor, test, and document the project for continued security and performance.
